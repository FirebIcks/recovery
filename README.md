# Fireblocks Recovery Utility

Fireblocks Recovery Utility is a set of tools for hard key backup and recovery. It includes Python scripts for key derivation and blockchain operations and a standalone Electron app which implements these scripts. The Python scripts update our existing [Fireblocks Recovery Key Utility](https://github.com/fireblocks/fireblocks-key-recovery-tool), and the Electron app obsoletes our existing HTML derivation tool.

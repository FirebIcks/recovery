# Wallet Derivation helpers

TypeScript methods and classes for deriving a wallet's private/public keys and address from extended private/public keys. Used by [Recovery Utility](../recovery-utility/) to generate wallet keys and addresses and by [Recovery Relay](../recovery-relay/) to generate public keys for checking balances and blockchain state.

Included in the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) frontends using [next-transpile-modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules).

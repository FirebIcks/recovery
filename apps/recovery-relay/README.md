## ðŸ“š User Guide

After using [Recovery Utility](../recovery-utility/) on on an airgapped device to recover private keys and wallets in a disaster:

- Get the balance of a vault account or asset, or start a withdrawal.
- Scan the QR code shown in Recovery Utility with a phone or an internet-connected computer to open a Recovery Relay URL.
- To send data back to Recovery Utility, use a webcam on the airgapped to scan a QR code from Recovery Relay.

You can set the Recovery Relay URL in Recovery Utility settings. You can use this repository to build and host the site static files yourself.

## Development Scripts

Use the [Recovery Utility monorepo](../../) for development and deployment as Recovery Utility depends on several other packages.

Recovery Relay, like Recovery Utility, is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) on the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, using [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) components. It can be hosted on any static file server.

### Build for production

```bash
yarn build
```

When configuring in CI such as Vercel, set the root directory to `apps/recovery-relay` and the build script to:

```
cd ../.. && npx turbo run build --filter=@fireblocks/recovery-relay
```

### Start development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
